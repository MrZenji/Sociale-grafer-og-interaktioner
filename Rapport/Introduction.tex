Have you ever wondered why all your friends on twitter have more followers than you?
In this project we will create a twitter bot, and try figure out which people
that are more likely to followback and which who are not. Our bot is named Nikki Masti
and is a beatifull girl with a dream of becoming a model. To make this project simpler,
we only follow people from San Francisco. The bot will try and act like a human being using
data machine learning with python and an EC2 server using crontab. We then keep track
of who we follow and who follows us back so we can analyse the profiles using NaiveBayesClassifier,
and hopefully find out what features that makes people follow us back.
