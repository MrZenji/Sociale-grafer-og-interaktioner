Which tools from the class (network science, natural language processing, machine learning) have you used? 

To classify the data, we use a simple naive bayes classifier. However by using this classifier we make the assumption that all of the features are independent of each other. By independent of each other we mean, that there shouldn't be any correlation between the chances of the different features. However in our case we expect to have a correlation between the followers and how many other users the user follows. We choose to disregard this correlation and make the assumption, that all of our features are independent. This assumption can be made because we are dealing with real people.\\
Creating features are the most important when creating a classifier, without features that utilize the date the most, your classifier wont give you a great answer. In our case we use followers and friends count, and the date of the profile creation. We also wanted
