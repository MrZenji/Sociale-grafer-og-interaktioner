\section{Introduction}
Introducing the idea of the course and your bot's personality.\\

\section{Interventions}
Briefly describe your original tweets and timing strategy (for tweeting and retweeting) for the various interventions.\\

\section{Implementation}
Describe the workings of your final project bot (how have you used the tools from the class, how did you implement the tools in Python - think flow-charts)?\\

\section{Susceptibility analysis}
This is the central part of the report. Present the analysis related to your susceptiblity experiments. Include the following sub-headings.

\subsection{Statistics}
Report the central data - it's a good idea to use plots as well as tables.

\subsection{Theory}
Which tools from the class (network science, natural language processing, machine learning) have you used? 

\section{Conclusions}
What have you learned from the course? Would you do anything differently? Did your strategy work? Which advice would you offer to prospective bot designers.
