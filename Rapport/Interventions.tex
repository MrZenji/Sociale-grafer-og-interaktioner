Briefly describe your original tweets and timing strategy (for tweeting and retweeting) for the various interventions.\\

\subsection{Our original tweets}


\textbf{Timing Strategy}\\
Our timing on the tweets, was in such a way, so that we usually made two tweets per day, one in the morning and another tweet once more in the evening. However since the tweets needed to be written manually we saw no reason to create a script which could post it for us. By doing it manually we also gained the advantage of having the tweets look like they were human made.
