Which advice would you offer to prospective bot designers.

Throughout the course of this project, we have created a Twitter bot, using the Twitter REST API. With this bot we were able to automatic follow people living in San Francisco, and create original tweets fitting our bots personality. We also retweet'et tweets, that had specific keyword in them. Because Twitter doesn't allow you to follow an infinite amount of people a day, we created a classifier to specify if the people we found would have a high probability to follow us back. Due to the low accuracy of the classifier, we would still follow people that doesn't follow us back, and we would ignore some that had the potential to follow us. But if we said that the people we tried to classify only needed to have a 60\% probability to follow us, we would get a higher chance of following people, that would follow us back.\\
A thought we had was when we followed people, that we sent them a private message, that might have given them more encouragement to follow back\\
To other bot designers we would say that a great idea is to create a profile with interest that are general and and be a girl.
